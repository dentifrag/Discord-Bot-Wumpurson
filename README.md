I programmed this bot with a friend of mine for our personal Discord server. It would read messages sent in the text channels and parse them for swear words. If there was a swear it would access a database to keep track of how many swears a user said. It also other functionality with different APIs listed below.

# APIs Used:
Astronomy Picture of the Day,
Google Static Maps,
PokeAPI,
ISS Location

# Database
This uses a MongoDB databse to hold usernames, and the amount tips they have contributed to the tip jar

# WARNING:
Part of this bot is alerting people to swear words. The file 'swears.txt' has a list of inappropiate words and slurs that shouldn't be said anywhere; for the purpose of preventing swears.
