# Wumpurson
I programmed this bot with a friend of mine for a Discord server, and it would read messages sent in the text channels to parse them for swear words. If there was a swear it would access a database to keep track of how many swears a user said. It also has other functionality with the different APIs listed below.

# APIs Used:
NASA: Astronomy Picture of the Day,
Google Static Maps,
PokeAPI,
ISS Location
# Database
This uses MongoDB to hold usernames, and the amount tips they have contributed to the tip jar
