# Wumpurson
I programmed this bot with a friend of mine. We essentially combined our two bot together into one, and adding some new commands and features to it. This is an updated version of my previous Discord bot made in Java. 

# APIs Used:
Astronomy Picture of the Day,
Google Static Maps,
PokeAPI,
ISS Location

# Database
This uses a MongoDB databse to hold usernames, and the amount tips they have contributed to the tip jar

# WARNING:
Part of this bot is alerting people to swear words. The file 'swears.txt' has a list of inappropiate words and slurs that shouldn't be said anywhere; for the purpose of preventing swears.
