# Wumpurson
I programmed this bot with a friend of mine. We essentially combined our two bot together into one, and adding some new commands and features to it.

# APIs Used:
Astronomy Picture of the Day,
Google Static Maps,
PokeAPI,
ISS Location

# Database
This uses a MongoDB databse to hold usernames, and the amount tips they have contributed to the tip jar

# WARNING:
Part of this bot is alerting people to swear words. The class 'Swearing' has a list of inappropiate words and slurs that shouldn't be said anywhere; for the purpose of preventing swears.
